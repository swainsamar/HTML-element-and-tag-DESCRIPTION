 	Why Study JavaScript?
 	JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:

   	1. HTML to define the content of web pages

   	2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages

   	3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

  	This tutorial is about JavaScript, and how JavaScript works with HTML and CSS.

  	Did You Know?
  	JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.

 	JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
 	ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
