<p align="right">The world is falling short of adjectives to describe the Indian captain
Virat Kohli. He is batting like a dream and almost every time that he walks 
out to bat in One-Day International cricket doesn’t settle for anything but a 
hundred. He scored the 35th ODI ton of his career and has played just 208 
matches. Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan found the perfect way to describe 
his game and said, he’s “playing like a miracle”.</p>.
“The way he is going, for him the term ‘sky is the limit’ falls short, for
 <p align="center">him ‘universe is the limit’. He is really fit and that makes it easier for 
him to keep going and I am sure he will be able to play for the next 8-9 
years as he plans. His fitness also helps him take the singles and doubles, 
his ability to gather so many runs without taking a lot of risks is again a 
standout feature,” he stated.</p>

Irfan praised Rohit for his ability to produce the big knocks with little 
or no trouble whatsoever. He said: “He’s outstanding. When he scores a 
hundred he goes big. His movement into theshots is very fluent and thus 
shot making is very easy for him. 
big ones with such ease and he is very still <blockquote align="right">while playing his shots. 
It is this ability to play the big ones that makes it much easier for 
him to get the big knocks.</blockquote>


Kohli along with openers <q><b>Shikhar Dhawan</b><q> and Rohit Sharma did the bulk 
of the scoring for India in the ODI series. Notably, the skipper hit 
558 runs, thereby becoming the first batsman to score more than 500 runs
in a bilateral series.
